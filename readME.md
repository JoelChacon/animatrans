##Walkthrough

######Before you look at the CSS files first look at the html for the corresponding page to get an understanding of the structure and selector names. Open up the html in the browser to see what it looks like without animations or transitions.

###Complete the different pages in this order:
####1) Landing - teaser(styles.css)
####2) Index - fsImage, blurMenu, skewMenu
####3) Space - planets
####4) Graphic - parallax
