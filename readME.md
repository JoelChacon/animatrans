## Instructions
###Build a Teaser Page
This teaser/landing page uses animate.css, reset.css, CSS:linear-gradient,transition, and pseudo-classes(hover,active). 
###Images... Images everywhere!
This full screen slideshow background uses modernizr and CSS: animations.
###We need a cool looking menu
####This is has two options: 
######1) A blur menu that uses css transitions, pseudo-class(hover), blur created by transparency and white text-shadow. 
######2) A skewed blur menu that uses the same as above and includes CSS 2D transforms.
